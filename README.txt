For this wardrobe project, I turned it into a store for heroes.
In the home page you have the shopkeeper welcoming you and explaining to you what you can do.
(For fun and space filler, hodor is hanging out in the shop at the bottom of the homepage.)


By clicking "Buy/Browse", you will be taken to the model index 
checking out all the goodies.

"Check it out!" will bring you to the details for that item. 
Giving you the occasion/description, season, color, etc.
"Buy it!" will bring you to the delete page.

I turned the delete page into a way of "buying" the item, this way it'll take
it off the shelf (index).

By going to the "Sell" option (whether via the nav bar or from the home page),
it'll go to the "Create" page. This is will be where the user will "fill out a form" for the 
shopkeeper and selling the item to him. When the item is created, the shopkeeper will
put it on the shelf (index).



for full user experience,
here's some store music:
